# Lesson 6: Scrum Framework

## Introduction to Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework designed to facilitate collaboration, improve productivity, and deliver high-quality products in a dynamic environment. It is particularly effective in managing complex projects where requirements are likely to change. Scrum provides a structured approach to project management, emphasizing teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress. This lesson will explore the key roles, artifacts, and events in the Scrum framework, as well as provide guidance on role-playing Scrum meetings to enhance understanding and practice.

## Roles in Scrum

Scrum defines three primary roles, each with specific responsibilities that contribute to the success of the project:

### 1. Scrum Master

**Definition**: The Scrum Master is a facilitator and coach who helps the Scrum Team understand and implement Scrum practices. They are responsible for ensuring that the team adheres to Scrum principles and practices.

**Responsibilities**:
- **Servant Leadership**: The Scrum Master serves the team by removing impediments that hinder progress and fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and productivity.
- **Coaching**: They coach the team on Scrum practices, helping members understand their roles and responsibilities.
- **Facilitating Scrum Events**: The Scrum Master facilitates key Scrum events, ensuring they are productive and focused.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: They act as a liaison between the Scrum Team and stakeholders, ensuring clear communication and alignment.

### 2. Product Owner

**Definition**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. They are the primary point of contact for stakeholders and represent the voice of the customer.

**Responsibilities**:
- **Product Backlog Management**: The Product Owner creates, prioritizes, and maintains the Product Backlog, ensuring that it reflects the most valuable features and requirements.
- **Defining Acceptance Criteria**: They define clear acceptance criteria for each backlog item to ensure that the team understands what constitutes "done."
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure that the product meets their needs and expectations.
- **Vision Communication**: They communicate the product vision to the Scrum Team, ensuring alignment and understanding of project goals.

### 3. Development Team

**Definition**: The Development Team is a cross-functional group of professionals responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of each Sprint.

**Responsibilities**:
- **Self-Organization**: The Development Team is self-organizing and decides how to accomplish their work without being directed by others.
- **Collaboration**: They collaborate closely to design, develop, test, and deliver the product increment.
- **Commitment to Quality**: The team is responsible for maintaining high-quality standards and ensuring that the increment meets the Definition of Done.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The Development Team reflects on their processes and performance during Sprint Retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.

## Artifacts in Scrum

Scrum defines several artifacts that provide transparency and facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders:

### 1. Product Backlog

**Definition**: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other requirements for the product. It serves as the single source of truth for the work to be done.

**Characteristics**:
- **Dynamic**: The Product Backlog is continuously updated and refined based on feedback, changing requirements, and new insights.
- **Prioritized**: Items in the backlog are prioritized by the Product Owner based on their value to the customer and the overall project goals.
- **Detailed Appropriately**: Higher-priority items are detailed more thoroughly, while lower-priority items may remain less defined until they are closer to being worked on.

### 2. Sprint Backlog

**Definition**: The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog that the Development Team commits to completing during a Sprint. It includes the selected backlog items and a plan for delivering them.

**Characteristics**:
- **Commitment**: The Sprint Backlog reflects the team's commitment to delivering specific items during the Sprint.
- **Visibility**: The Sprint Backlog is visible to the entire team, promoting transparency and accountability.
- **Adaptable**: The Development Team can adjust the Sprint Backlog as needed during the Sprint based on new information or challenges.

### 3. Increment

**Definition**: The Increment is the sum of all completed Product Backlog items at the end of a Sprint. It represents a potentially releasable version of the product.

**Characteristics**:
- **Definition of Done**: The Increment must meet the Definition of Done, which includes quality criteria and acceptance criteria defined by the Product Owner.
- **Potentially Releasable**: The Increment should be in a state that allows it to be released to customers or stakeholders if desired.
- **Cumulative**: Each Increment builds on previous Increments, contributing to the overall product development.

## Events in Scrum

Scrum includes several time-boxed events that provide structure and facilitate collaboration among team members:

### 1. Sprint

**Definition**: A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration, typically lasting 1 to 4 weeks, during which the Scrum Team works to complete a set of Product Backlog items.

**Characteristics**:
- **Fixed Duration**: Sprints have a fixed duration, and the team commits to completing the selected backlog items within that time frame.
- **Consistent Rhythm**: Sprints create a consistent rhythm for the team, allowing for regular delivery of increments and feedback.

### 2. Sprint Planning

**Definition**: Sprint Planning is a collaborative event that occurs at the beginning of each Sprint. The Scrum Team meets to determine what work will be completed during the Sprint and how it will be accomplished.

**Key Components**:
- **What**: The team selects items from the Product Backlog to include in the Sprint Backlog.
- **How**: The team discusses how they will deliver the selected items and creates a plan for the Sprint.

### 3. Daily Scrum

**Definition**: The Daily Scrum is a short, time-boxed meeting (typically 15 minutes) held every day during the Sprint. The Development Team uses this event to synchronize activities and plan for the next 24 hours.

**Key Questions**:
- What did I accomplish since the last Daily Scrum?
- What do I plan to accomplish before the next Daily Scrum?
- Are there any impediments blocking my progress?

### 4. Sprint Review

**Definition**: The Sprint Review is held at the end of each Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog based on feedback from stakeholders.

**Key Components**:
- **Demonstration**: The Development Team demonstrates the completed Increment to stakeholders.
- **Feedback**: Stakeholders provide feedback, which may lead to adjustments in the Product Backlog.

### 5. Sprint Retrospective

**Definition**: The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. The Scrum Team reflects on the Sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

**Key Questions**:
- What went well during the Sprint?
- What could be improved?
- What actions will we take to improve in the next Sprint?

## Role-Playing Scrum Meetings
